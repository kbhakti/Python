# Python

#Project1 - About Me
Introduction: This project helps to learn how to write a Python program telling people all about themselves. Create ASCII art (images from text) and perform calculations based on user input.

Learning Objectives
Sequencing;
Variables;
Converting between text and integer (whole number) data types.

Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.

Challenges
What’s on your mind? - writing a first Python program using the print statement.
“About yourself” - printing text and ASCII art to the screen. Remember that the code children write in Trinket is public. Remind them not to share any personal information like their full name or address.
“Your age in dog years” - performing a calculation based on the user’s input.

#Project2 - Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Introduction : This project helps to learn how to make a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors using variables and conditional statements.

Learning Objectives
Variables;
Selection (if, elif, else);
Boolean '==' and 'and'

Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs

Challenges
“ASCII art” - Use conditional logic to display ASCII art for rock, paper and scissors.
“Create a new game” - Duplicate the Rock, Paper, Scissors game and remix it to create a new game.

#Project3 - Turtle Race 

Introduction: This project introduces for loops through a fun turtle race game. Loops are used to draw the race track and to make the turtles move a random number of steps each turn. Each one player can pick a turtle, the one that gets the furthest is the winner.

Learning Objectives - For loops, Random, Python turtle graphics

Challenges
More lines - changing the number of times a loop repeats;
Race times - adding more turtles, includes adding code inside a loop;
Do a twirl - make turtles spin round at the start by writing new for loops;
Dashed lines - change solid lines into dashed lines, requires a nested loop.

#Project4 - Team Chooser

Introduction: This project will help to learn how to make a program to split a list of players into 2 random teams. This project teaches lists and using files.

Learning Objectives : Lists, Loading list data from a file.

Challenges:
“Adding more players” - adding elements to a players list;
“Choosing for team B” - creating a new teamB list to add random players to;
“Random team names” - creating and using a new teamNames list to assign random names to teams;
“Storing team names” - storing team names in a file, and loading them into a teamNames variable;
“More teams” - splitting players into 3 teams instead of 2.
