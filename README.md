# Python

#Project1 - About Me
Introduction: This project helps to learn how to write a Python program telling people all about themselves. Create ASCII art (images from text) and perform calculations based on user input.

Learning Objectives
Sequencing;
Variables;
Converting between text and integer (whole number) data types.

Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.

Challenges
What’s on your mind? - writing a first Python program using the print statement.
“About yourself” - printing text and ASCII art to the screen. Remember that the code children write in Trinket is public. Remind them not to share any personal information like their full name or address.
“Your age in dog years” - performing a calculation based on the user’s input.

#Project2 - Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Introduction : This project helps to learn how to make a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors using variables and conditional statements.

Learning Objectives
Variables;
Selection (if, elif, else);
Boolean '==' and 'and'

Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs

Challenges
“ASCII art” - Use conditional logic to display ASCII art for rock, paper and scissors.
“Create a new game” - Duplicate the Rock, Paper, Scissors game and remix it to create a new game.
